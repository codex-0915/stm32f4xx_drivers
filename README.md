# STM32F4xx Driver Development

## Goal
- To practice embedded C programming
- To familiarize on embedded software and microcontrollers
- Basically for learning and just a hobby of learning new things

### TO-DO:
- Update this file for more updates for this project
- Document on how to import and use this repository (it's basically just importing the folder/repository into STM32CubeIDE, and adding the include files on the IDE to remove errors of not finding the include files)
- Updating the comments on the driver files for further details and project documentation
